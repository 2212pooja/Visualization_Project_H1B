## Abstract

The H1B is an employment-based visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. Every year, the US immigration department receives over 200,000 petitions and selects 85,000 applications through a random process and the U.S. employer must submit a petition for an H1B visa to the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied to international students once they complete college or higher education and begin working in a full-time position. The project provides essential information on job titles, preferred regions of settlement, foreign applicants and employers' trends for H1B visa application. According to locations, employers, job titles and salary range make up most of the H1B petitions, so different visualization utilizing tools will be used in order to analyze and interpreted in relation to the trends of the H1B visa to provide a recommendation to the applicant. This report is the base of the project for Visualization of Complex Data class at the George Washington University, some examples in this project has an analysis for the different relevant variables (Case Status, Employer Name, SOC name, Job Title, Prevailing Wage, Worksite, and Latitude and Longitude information) from Kaggle and Office of Foreign Labor Certification(OFLC) in order to see the H1B visa changes in the past several decades.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 10 columns and covers a total of 3 million records spanning from 2011-2016. The relevant columns in the dataset include case status, employer name, SOC name, jobe title, full time position, prevailing wage, year, worksite, and latitude and longitude information.


## Data Processing

* Doing some data preprocessing to transform the raw data into an understandable format.
* Find and combine any other external datasets to enrich the analysis such as dataset of FY2017.
* To make appropriated Visualizations, variables should be Developed and compiled into visualization programs.
* Draw a geo map and scatter plot to compare the fastest growth in fixed value and in percentages.
* Extract some aspects, and analyze the changes in employers' preference as well as forecasts for the future trends.

* Technical Jobs fill up the majority of Top 10 Jobs among foreign workers such as Computer Systems Analyst and Software Developers.
* The employers located in the metro areas thrive to find foreign workforce who can fill the technical position that they have in their organization.
* States like California, New York, Washington, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Texas are the prime location for foreign workers and provide many job opportunities. 
* Top Companies such Infosys, Tata, IBM India that submit most H1B Visa Applications are companies based in India associated with software and IT services.
* Data Scientist position has experienced an exponential growth in terms of H1B visa applications and jobs are clustered in West region with the highest number.
